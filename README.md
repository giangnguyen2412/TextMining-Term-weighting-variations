Term Frequency (TF): is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. The term frequency is often divided by the document length to normalize.
I implemented the TF-IDF based on formula of this site: https://medium.com/greyatom/an-introduction-to-bag-of-words-in-nlp-ac967d43b428
